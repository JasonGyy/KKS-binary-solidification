    "We are setting out to simulate solidification of two-component alloy with a lenticular phase diagram, or \"binary isomorphous\" system, such as Cu-Ni. The free energy curves for pure phases, $f_S$ and $f_L$, are generated from a CALPHAD database, rather than a regular solution model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to this thermodynamic description, we are adopting the KKS treatment of diffuse interfaces. This simply means that at equilibrium, chemical potential is constant through the interface, and composition varies to make it so. More concretely, composition is defined by the phase fraction $\\phi$ and two fictitious concentration fields, $C_S$ and $C_L$, representing composition of the pure phase, as\n",
